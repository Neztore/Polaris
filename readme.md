# Polaris v4
This branch represents the start of work on Polaris v4. I'm going try to get this done this week.
I'm making on promises on whether or not this actually happens.


## What its going to use
- Aquarius for verification
- Typescript
- MySQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL. Not Rethinkdb, most likely.
	* Maybe use TypeORM. Maybe not.

- Node-fetch



### Web panel
There are no plans to re-do the web panel, though it's database will likely need updated to whatever Polaris uses.
